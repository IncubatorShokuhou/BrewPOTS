In this project, partially-observed time series datasets are taken as coffee beans.
As you can see, there is a coffee pot in the PyPOTS logo on the left,
and the tutorials in this repo are going to show you how to use this pot (i.e. PyPOTS) to brew your
coffee beans (i.e. POTS data) into a cup of delicious coffee (i.e. what you want).
For sure, it seems that we also need a coffee grinder to help us grind beans into powder (i.e. preprocessing).
What do you think this grinder will be named? üòâ
