## <p align="center">Welcome to BrewedPOTS</p>
**<p align="center">The tutorials help brew your Partially-Observed Time Series datasets</p>**

In this project, partially-observed time series datasets are taken as coffee beans. 
And as you can see, there is a coffee pot in the PyPOTS logo.
The tutorials in this repo are going to show you how to use this pot (i.e. PyPOTS) to brew your 
coffee beans (i.e. POTS data) into a cup of delicious coffee (i.e. what you want). 
For sure, it seems that we also need a coffee grinder to help us mash beans into powder (i.e. preprocessing).
What do you think this grinder will be named? ðŸ˜‰
